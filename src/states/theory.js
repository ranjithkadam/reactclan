/**
State = data that can change over time
Used to make UI dynamic & interactive
When state changes → component re-renders (UI change).

Example: const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    count is initial value i.e, 0. and setCount is a method that handle the count value.
    and useState is a builtIn function that takes an argument and returns an array i.e,
    [count, setCount] in this example.
