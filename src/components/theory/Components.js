/**
 * Component: In React component is a basic building block used to create a user Interface.
 *  In Components we have two types:
 * 
 *  1. Function based Component- It is a normal JS Function which optionally requires properties
 *      and states returns .jsx file.
 * 
 * 
 *  2. Class based Component- It is normal JS class which optionally requires properties and 
 *       states and returns .jsx file.
 *      
 *  export: this export used to export the file to access anywhere in the package.
 *          we can export the component with default export and named export
 *  1. default export: the default export can use only once in a file with "default" keyword.
 *  2. names export: the multiple named components we can create in a single file with "{componentName}".
